This project was to create a copy of the Instagram sign-up page with my own added twist. In the 
end I created Boristagram.

There were a lot of challenged I faced with this project as it was my first-time using CSS.
One challenge I faced was that I couldn’t get the left image and background to align with the 
text box and background on the right side, so it too me a while to research and be able to 
correct it as different solutions would give me different problems. In the end I found out how 
to correct the problems by adding height and weight to the correct rations to align with each 
other.

Another difficulty I had was not being able to get the different classes to do the things I 
wanted then to do as I probably didn’t have enough specific ones and the classes I had were to 
vague for too many things so I had to break them down and create more divides so I could make 
each individual part in the html file do what I wanted it to do.

My last challenge I faced was getting the footer to align and stick to the bottom of the page, 
I ended up changing this when working on my page and ending up placing all the bottom page 
links at the bottom of the sign-up section to show more clarity.

In the end I completed my page to how I wanted it and am happy with the end product.
Additional features I could add would be links to download the application and a sign-in page 
if already singed-up somewhere near the bottom of the page. Also I could space out the page 
more to avoid it looking cluttered.
